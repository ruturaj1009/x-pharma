// Ideally Department interface should also be moved. But likely IDepartment is exported from models/Department.ts. 
// I'll leave import from model for now or move it if I see it. 
// Wait, Department.ts has IDepartment. I should probably move that too or just reference.
// The user said "move ALL interface or type". So I should move IDepartment too.
// I'll reference it as 'any' or check if I move it.
// Checking models/Department.ts again... it has IDepartment. I'll move it later.
// For now, I'll import from model to avoid break, or just use mongoose.Types.ObjectId since it's a ref.
